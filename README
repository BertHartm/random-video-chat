a web / flash based random video chat program, meant mostly as demonstration piece at the moment. Inspired by chatroulette / omegle type websites.

I do not recommend running this code in a production environment. It's meant primarily for educational purposes.

All code here is released under GPLv3

A few notes on setup:

1) You'll need to update the address of the rtmfp server in the chat.as script. I highly recommend using the Cumulus project (https://github.com/OpenRTMFP/Cumulus) for this.
2) The rails instance is only set up with a development configuration at the moment. It seems multithreading breaks the "reload the code everytime" portion of functionality for rails server, so it might behave a little differently.
